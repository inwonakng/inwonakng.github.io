Yarn version: 1.22.19

NPM version: 8.19.2

node version: 18.12.1




Built with react + typescript because I wanted to practice. Probably didn't need to use typescript. Bootstrap is used through reactstrap.

There really isn't much code, please feel free to use this project to fit your needs. If you do, make sure you change the homepage field of `package.json` to your domain. If your repository is named `${userName}.github.io` then that link should suffice. Otherwise, the address should be `${userName}.github.io/${projectName}`

To install, run `yarn install` (preferred) or `npm run install` from the root directory of the project after cloning the repository.
